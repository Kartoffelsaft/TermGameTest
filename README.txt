This is a very old project of mine. Everything except this paragraph exists for archiving purposes. You will find very na√Øve code, and some weird implementations of ideas. Also really incomplete build instructions. It's not a fun game, if you wanted to play it.

___

to compile, use this command:

make

requires libncurses5-dev package (or something that will satisfy the -lncurses argument in the makefile)
